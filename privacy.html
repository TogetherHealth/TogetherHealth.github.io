            <li>The Parties agree that the required method of monthly payment shall be by automatic payment, through a debit or credit card.</li>
            <li>If this Agreement is canceled by either party before the Agreement ends, We will review and settle your account as follows:</li>

        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h3>Non-Participation in Insurance</h3>
    <p>Your initials on this clause of the Agreement acknowledge the Patient’s understanding that neither Together Health, nor its Physicians, participate in any health insurance or HMO plans or panels and have opted out of Medicare. Neither makes any representations that the fees paid under this Agreement are covered by the Patient’s health insurance or other third-party payment plans. It is the Patient’s responsibility to determine whether reimbursement is available from a private, non-governmental insurance plan or HSA and to submit any required billing.</p>

    <h3>Medicare</h3>
    <p>This agreement acknowledges the Patient’s understanding that the Physician has opted out of Medicare, and as a result, Medicare cannot be billed for any services performed for the Member by the Physician. The Patient agrees not to bill Medicare or attempt to obtain Medicare reimbursement for any such services. If the Patient is eligible for Medicare, or becomes eligible during the term of this Agreement, then s/he will sign the Medicare Opt Out and Waiver Agreement, which will be sent as Appendix C and incorporated by reference. The Patient shall sign and renew the Medicare Opt Out and Waiver Agreement every two years, as required by law.</p>

    <h3>This Is Not Health Insurance</h3>
    <p>Your initials on this clause of the Agreement acknowledge Your understanding that this Agreement is not an insurance plan or a substitute for health insurance. The Patient understands that this Agreement does not replace any existing or future health insurance or health plan coverage that Members may carry. The Agreement does not include hospital services or any services not personally provided by Together Health or its clinicians. The Patient acknowledges that Together Health has advised the Patient to obtain or keep in full force, health insurance that will cover the Patient for healthcare not personally delivered by Together Health, and for hospitalizations and catastrophic events.</p>

    <h3>Communications</h3>
    <p>The Patient acknowledges that although the CLINIC shall comply with HIPAA privacy requirements, communications with the Physician using e-mail, facsimile, video chat, cell phone, texting, and other forms of electronic communication can never be absolutely guaranteed to be secure or confidential methods of communications. As such, Patient expressly waives the Clinician’s obligation to guarantee confidentiality with respect to the above means of communication. Patient further acknowledges that all such communications may become a part of the medical record.</p>

    <p>By providing an email address and cell phone number in the CLINIC’s electronic medical record system and payment system Hint, the Patient authorizes Together Health and its Clinicians to communicate with him/her/they by e-mail or text message regarding the Patient’s “protected health information” (PHI). The Patient further acknowledges:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>E-mail and text message are not necessarily secure mediums for sending or receiving PHI, and there is always a possibility that a third party may gain access;</li>
        <li>Although the Clinicians will make all reasonable efforts to keep email and text communications confidential and secure, neither Together Health nor the Clinicians can assure or guarantee the absolute confidentiality of these communications;</li>
        <li>At the discretion of the Clinician, e-mail and/or text communications may be made a part of Member’s permanent medical record;</li>
        <li>You understand and agree that e-mail and text messaging are not an appropriate means of communication in an emergency, for time-sensitive problems, or for disclosing sensitive information. In an emergency, or a situation that You could reasonably expect to develop into an emergency, You understand and agree to call 911 or go to the nearest Emergency room, and follow the directions of emergency personnel.</li>
        <li>Email/Text Messaging Usage: If You do not receive a response to an email or text message within 24 hours, You agree that you will contact the Physician by telephone or other means.</li>
        <li>Technical Failure: Neither Together Health, nor the Clinicians will be liable for any loss, injury, or expense arising from a delay in responding to a Patient, when that delay is caused by technical failure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Physician Absences</h3>
    <p>From time to time, due to vacations, illness, or personal emergency, the Physician may be temporarily unavailable to provide the services referred to above in this paragraph. In order to assist Patients in scheduling non-urgent visits, Together Health will notify Patients of any planned Physician absences as soon as the dates are confirmed. In the event of the Physician’s unplanned absences, Patients will be given the name and telephone number of an appropriate provider for the Patient to contact. Any treatment rendered by the substitute provider is not covered under this contract, but may be submitted to the Patient's health plan.</p>

    <h3>Change of Law</h3>
    <p>If there is a change of any relevant law, regulation or rule, federal, state or local, which affects the terms of this Agreement, the parties agree to amend this Agreement to comply with the law.</p>

    <h3>Severability</h3>
    <p>If any part of this Agreement is considered legally invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that part will be amended to the extent necessary to be enforceable and the remainder of the contract will stay in force as originally written.</p>

    <h3>Reimbursement for Services Rendered</h3>
    <p>If this Agreement is held to be invalid for any reason, and Together Health is required to refund fees paid by You, You agree to pay Together Health an amount equal to the fair market value of the medical services You received during the time period for which the refunded fees were paid.</p>

    <h3>Amendment</h3>
    <p>No amendment of this Agreement shall be binding on a party unless it is in writing and signed by all the parties, except for amendments made in compliance with the change of law clause.</p>

    <h3>Assignment</h3>
    <p>This Agreement, and any rights You may have under it, may not be assigned or transferred by You.</p>

    <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
    <p>This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties and replaces any earlier understandings and agreements whether they are written or oral.</p>

    <h3>No Waiver</h3>
    <p>In order to allow for the flexibility of certain terms of the Agreement, each party agrees that they may choose to delay or not to enforce the other party’s requirement or duty under this agreement (for example, notice periods, payment terms, etc.). Doing so will not constitute a waiver of that duty or responsibility. The party will have the right to enforce such terms again at any time.</p>

The Physician has informed Patient that Physician has opted out of the Medicare program and is not excluded from participating in Medicare Part B under Sections 1128, 1156, or 1892 or any other section of the Social Security Act.</p>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 allows physicians to “opt out” of Medicare and enter into private contracts with patients who are Medicare beneficiaries. In order to opt out, physicians are required to file an affidavit with each Medicare carrier that has jurisdiction over claims that they have filed (or that would have jurisdiction over claims had the physicians not opted out of Medicare). In essence, the physician must agree not to submit any Medicare claims nor receive any payment from Medicare for items or services provided to any Medicare beneficiary for two years.</p>
    <p>This Agreement between Beneficiary and Physician is intended to be the contract physicians are required to have with Medicare beneficiaries when physicians opt-out of Medicare. This Agreement is limited to the financial agreement between Physician and Beneficiary and is not intended to obligate either party to a specific course or duration of treatment.</p>

    <h4>Physician Responsibilities</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Physician agrees to provide Beneficiary such treatment as may be mutually agreed upon and at mutually agreed upon fees.</li>

        <li>Physician agrees not to execute this contract at a time when Beneficiary is facing an emergency or urgent healthcare situation.</li>
        <li>Physician agrees to provide Beneficiary with a signed copy of this document before items or services are furnished to Beneficiary under its terms. Physician also agrees to retain a copy of this document for the duration of the opt-out period.</li>
        <li>Physician agrees to submit copies of this contract to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) upon the request of CMS.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Beneficiary Responsibilities</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Beneficiary agrees to pay for all items or services furnished by Physician and understands that no reimbursement will be provided under the Medicare program for such items or services.</li>
        <li>Beneficiary understands that no limits under the Medicare program apply to amounts that may be charged by Physician for such items or services.</li>
        <li>Beneficiary agrees that s/he is not currently in an emergency or urgent health care situation.</li>
        <li>Beneficiary agrees not to submit a claim to Medicare and not to ask the Physician to submit a claim to Medicare.</li>
        <li>Beneficiary understands that Medicare payment will not be made for any items or services furnished by Physician that otherwise would have been covered by Medicare if there were no private contract and a proper Medicare claim had been submitted.</li>
        <li>Beneficiary understands that Beneficiary has the right to obtain Medicare-covered items and services from physicians and practitioners who have not opted out of Medicare, and that Beneficiary is not compelled to enter into private contracts that apply to other Medicare-covered items and services furnished by other physicians or practitioners who have not opted out of Medicare.</li>
        <li>Beneficiary understands that Medigap plans (under section 1882 of the Social Security Act) do not, and other supplemental insurance plans may elect not to, make payments for such items and services not paid for by Medicare.</li>
        <li>Beneficiary understands that CMS has the right to obtain copies of this contract upon request.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Medicare Exclusion Status of Physician</h4>
    <p>Beneficiary understands that Physician has not been excluded from participation under the Medicare program under section 1128, 1156, 1892, or any other sections of the Social Security Act.</p>

    <h4>Duration of the Contract</h4>
    <p>This contract becomes effective on today’s date and will continue in effect until otherwise notified. Either party may terminate treatment with reasonable notice to the other party, as provided in the agreement. Notwithstanding this right to terminate treatment, both Physician and Beneficiary agree that the obligation not to pursue Medicare reimbursement for items and services provided under this contract will survive this contract.</p>

    <h4>Successors and Assigns</h4>
    <p>The parties agree that this agreement will be fully binding on their heirs, successors, and assigns. Physician and Beneficiary intend to be legally bound by signing this agreement on today’s date.</p>

    <p class="mb-5">Signature of Beneficiary</p>
